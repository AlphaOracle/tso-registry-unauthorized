{"general": "FTSO AU: Tim and Neil. Australians with South African and English heritage. Tim relocated to Dubai in July 2022, Neil still in Australia. Both have backgrounds in various areas of computing and software development.", "infrastructure": "FTSO AU: We're 100% AWS cloud based. Services include (all on seperate instances) Songbird (private) full archival node, Songbird (public) pruned node. Flare (private) pruned node. Various data farms & collectors. Songbird & Flare FTSO servers. OpenVPN server. Attestation nodes (not currently running), BTC / DOGE / LTC, Algorand, Rippled.    Current costs are approximately USD$5000 / month.", "safeguards": "FTSO AU: We're currently on iteration ~4? of our FTSO algorithm with safeguards against depegs and erroneous spikes in data being put in place.", "availability": "FTSO AU: We've been operating Songbird nodes since mid 2021, providing a public node for users to connect to Songbird via MetaMask, for delegation purposes. On average we have 2m requests to the node each day.    We've been submitting on Songbird since epoch 1 and the same on Flare.     Availability has been high due to having a backup node, which was used many times in early days before we changed DB.     Outages with our submission service have been rectified quickly due to our 7am to 11pm availability 7 days a week. AWS alarms notifying us of outages 24hrs a day have meant very little downtime.", "selling": "FTSO AU: Originally we'd planned to sell 15-20% to cover costs on Songbird, and did so. With the declining token price and increased competition we then depleted all rewards we accrued in the first few months to cover costs for the last 12+ months.     We'll sell whatever we need to, in order to continue running all necessary infrastructure and public tools.", "tooling": "FTSO AU: We built the first ALL provider delegation platform app.ftso.au and gave the public access to our Songbird node.     We've built Flare Metrics - FlareMetrics.io, with more functionality planned.    We've created 50+ blog posts, tutorials and YouTube content to educate the users on all things in the Flare ecosystem.    We've created Flare Builders - flare.builders to showcase all the great projects being built on Songbird and Flare. More developments planned.    Various other projects and extra functionality to existing platforms currently being discussed.", "sgb_claim_address": "FTSO AU: does not wish to reveal any additional information", "flr_claim_address": "FTSO AU: does not wish to reveal any additional information"}
