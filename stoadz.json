As discussed, my partner and myself are both whales (FLR and SGB). We hold a lot.   What we hold vs what we re-invest back into building on the Network is our concern.   We reinvest rewards back into our ecosystem to build on FLR, XRPL and SGB and to cover hosting costs.  Reality is our Product Suites will result in more value to the Network, as opposed to holding onto assets.   There is this notion that if you sell your rewards you are a bad actor or steward.  Incorrect, if I sell my rewards at 7c and it's currently trading at 1c, and I have USDT now and enough runway to continue to build in a bear market, that's called being a credible business and allows Product Suites to be delivered on a Network where there are few.   Building on the Infrastructure will result in price appreciation of the underlying assets. This is not a Macro way of looking at anything.", "tooling": "dApp (Black Box)  Games   Verse  sToadz", "sgb_claim_address": "NA ", "flr_claim_address": "NA"}
