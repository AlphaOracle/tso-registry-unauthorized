  "general": "4 dads, 13 children. Childhood friends and born and raised in the Midwest. 2 full stack engineers, a real cfo and a mysterious defi dude.. 60+ combined years of software consulting experience ranging from treasury management, healthcare, financial sectors, defense and cleaning fishtanks.",
  "infrastructure": "Unfortunately, we do run our own infrastructure. Our host of choice is AWS and servers based in Virginia. We run 2 observation nodes, we practice docker inception, run dedicated vpn servers (f*ck you cz), and monitor submissions with pi’s in someone’s basement. UPDATE: 5 bare metal servers racked, electrical work finished. These will serve as backup nodes and will be used for attestation (4dads was chosen as 1 of 5 FTSOs to participate in beta) ",
  "safeguards": "Our algo is very “special”...we reflect prices from over 20+ cex’s and written from scratch using NodeJS, with a lot of ascii art. We have depegs protections and feeds cut off when they fall below a certain thresholds for the following stables: usdt, usdc, and busd",
  "availability": "Since epoch 6-ish on the Songbird Network. It's been awhile, but we can confirm that Alex dupre was here before us.",
  "selling": "We operate at a loss financially and mentally.",
  "tooling": "We have some ideas, but need to cleanup some people in the background first…and maybe we should replace our placeholder website one day. The cleanup continues...",
