  "general": "Based in the Netherlands, SolidiFi FTSO is the data provider of SolidiFi. We are a small team that consists of 1 senior developer, 1 junior developer, and two other juniors that help with testing. Together, we are just a group of friends making the most out of this immense opportunity to be part of the birth of a new network which we believe has fantastic potential. Lead developer, Ferdi, has studied architecture at the TU Delft, specifically the avant-garde Hyperbody research group that focussed on how artificial intelligence can aid in the design process of public buildings. Ferdi's passion for unification of aesthetics and technology is reflected in the recently launched mobile app SolidiFi Wallet.",
  "infrastructure": "For SolidiFi FTSO, we run our own infrastructure, hosted at cloud provider Digital Ocean. We run 2 observation nodes for Songbird and 2 observation nodes for Flare. For our public services (SolidiFi Web and SolidiFi Wallet) we have several APIs as well. All nodes and APIs are behind load balancers, just in case one server goes down, another one will handle the network traffic until the other server is up and running again. We have also started making preparations for running a validator node. Finally, we also run a CMS for the website and other services for the FTSO data provider (analysis etc). Current monthly infrastructure costs (for the FTSO data provider alone) are approximate $450. All applications are written Javascript using the React, React Native and NodeJS frameworks.",
  "safeguards": "The SolidiFi FTSO provider checks the USDT value (if available) on every exchange and converts trading prices to true USD prices. Our provider submits prices from a certain combination of exchanges. Due to its dynamic nature, if an exchange falls aways, naturally the provider continues with available exchanges. (We also monitor the availability on each exchange of the 12 assets through our custom built FTSO data provider CMS)",
  "availability": "SolidiFi FTSO data provider started submitting prices on Songbird on the 6th October 2023. For Flare it began on the 18th of October. In the first few weeks we were finetuning our software and servers and did experience a few down times. However after releasing a second version, the FTSO data provider became stable. Challenges were ahead and we simply did not have enough voting power to be able to submit. After having switched off our provider for a few months due to a lack of voting power, SolidiFi FTSO data provider did eventually receive a delegation boost from Flare. While setting up our systems last year, there have been many times where we would wake up in the night just to check if everything is still submitting. It's a nice challenge and to see when all goes well feels like a great accomplishment. Today, our provider has matured and is becoming more accurate and rewarding with each new release. Our battle for being a top provider has only just begun :)",
  "selling": "For the first 4 to 6 months, we have put in quite some work for development and infrastructure and paid it from our own pockets. Till then our rewards were about $10 to $30 a week or so (could be a little more but roughly it was within that range). As we mentioned earlier our costs on a monthly basis are $450. So the $40 to $120 worth of rewards that we earned monthly, was sold in its entirety just to have at least some financial relief. Later on, when the delegation boost by Flare was activated income increased to $100 per week per network. We do have to sell this for the time being to cover operational and development costs.",
