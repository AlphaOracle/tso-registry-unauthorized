  "infrastructure": "Our own infrastructure, other info are confidential or not relevant.",

  "availability": "We were in the first set of providers on both Songbird and Flare. Since the inception of the networks I think we had about 99.9% of availability. It's not a guarantee for the future, of course.",
  "selling": "Until now (more than a year) we haven't sold a single SGB or FLR. This doesn't mean that we never will, obviously.",
  "tooling": "We've built one of the first tools to wrap & delegate, and to show FTSO provider performances, available on https://ftso.alexdupre.com  A-FTSO is also part of a larger team behind BlazeSwap, a DEX to swap ERC-20 tokens, fully integrated with the Flare components, available on https://blazeswap.xyz  We also contribute to many open source projects to improve the support for the Flare blockchains."
