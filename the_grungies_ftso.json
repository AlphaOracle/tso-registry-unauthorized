{"general": "The Grungies FTSO    The Grungies team consists of  two members, @mouradski and @0Llac3, both French.     Mouradski is a Java backend developer with professional experience in machine learning. To learn more about his background, you can check his LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/mourad-toumi-b5389178/ .   He has created several tools for the SGB and Flare ecosystems, which will be discussed in the relevant section.     Our prior experience of working together on an XRPL project, Utility Scan, which traced ODL transactions on the XRPL, has allowed us to develop a strong bond of trust and mutual understanding.    Our journey on Songbird started with the launch of a collection of NFTs inspired by the 90s Grunge music scene, followed by another series dedicated to the Metal music genre. As we gained more experience and wanted to contribute more actively, we ran a Songbird node (request made to Tom) to utilize the websocket API for our project \"Discord bot for monitoring sales on the secondary market\". Later, we decided to run an FTSO as we already had experience with exchange APIs ( Utility-Scan). This not only presents an exciting challenge, but also allows us to play a significant role in these ecosystems.  Most importantly, Mouradksi's experience allows us to be 100% independent on our algorithm and  strategies.", "infrastructure": "Grungies FTSO    Yes we run our own infra :      \u2022 Hosted at Ilyad data center in France:          \u25e6 Songbird node          \u25e6 Flare node          \u25e6 Both in Observe mode      \u2022  Application server for the following software: (DP FTSO/STSO)      \u2022 IPFS cluster      \u2022 Hosted at Hetzner data center:          \u25e6 Flare validator  Cost : 600 Euros / Month", "safeguards": "Grungies FTSO   We determine the value of the stable coins prevalent in the market by aggregating median prices from four sources, including USDT/USD ,BUSD/USD, etc. To standardize the prices, we perform systematic conversions from the stable coins to USD.
